## 5.1 Modes
Your keyboard has two modes: office, which is fixed, and program, which can be remapped using the KB84 Config program.
To swap modes, Fn + F12/(M) and hold for THREE SECONDS.
The key, which is also the (M) light will stay on, showing you're in program mode.
Do it again to switch back to office mode.

## 5.2 Hotkeys
* Fn + ⤓ (F9) : APC(Actuation Point Change) mode toggle between low (1 flash of CAPSLOCK)  and high (2 flashes of CAPSLOCK)

    * default = 2.5mm ; low (1 flash) = 2mm ; high (2 flashes) = 3mm
    * When reconnected to pc, it becomes default. (2.5mm)
    * If you have old version of plum84, you need to press “FN + PAGEUP / PAGEDOWN” instead.

* Fn + Win : Lock Windows key
* Fn + Win⇌Alt : swap Windows key and Alt

# Extra

## 9.0 For MacOS user who often use F1 - F12
 *  If you are using MacOS, Fn + F1 – F12 would not work as you expected.
ksmigrod explanied the reason for the problem in reddit. \
  “On Linux in Bluetooth mode this keyboard is supported by Apple keyboard driver. This driver tries to mimic Apple keyboard behaviour and does conversion from function key (F1-F12) to media key codes on the fly. NiZ keyboard does not send any codes for its function key, so Linux's keyboard driver cannot map Fn+F1 to F1.” \
 https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/6yieo6/review_plum_84_35g_bluetooth_nonrgb/   \
Though he explained the solution in Linux, it seems it doesn't apply to MacOS. \
Instead, I suggest you to toggle following macOS option as you want.  \
(System Preferences > Keyboard > Use F1, F2, etc. keys are standard function keys …) 

<br>


## 10.0 KBD84 software
When using the KBD84 software to program the keyboard, be sure to select ReadAll first.  This reads the current keyboard mappings from the keyboard.  If you don’t select ReadAll first, you will be essentially starting with blank mappings and you will need to map every single key.
